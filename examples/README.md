This directory contains independant scripts defining the basic logic needed to be included in the [APIs](./Backend/) to expose in order to communicate with VisionsTrust Data Exchange protocol.

It also includes the optional implementation example of a [frontend consent popup](./Frontend/) generation to allow the user to generate a consent popup from within your platform.
